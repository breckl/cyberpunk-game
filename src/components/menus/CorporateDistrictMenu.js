Drones patrol the skies, biometric scanners guard every entrance, and the corporate logos blaze like beacons of power against the night sky. This is where the real money flows, where deals that shape the city are made behind closed doors. The contrast with the streets below couldn't be more starkâ€”this is the world of the haves, while the have-nots struggle in the shadows below.",
